Hello,

In this project, I want to explore working with data. 
I utilized the YouTube APIv3, and the documentation is quite comprehensive. 
It's my first venture into working with data, and I find it enjoyable.

I selected various channels on YouTube, and upon extracting the data, I compared all the channels based on views and names to identify the channels with the highest views.
In the second part, I focused on the channel with the most viewers. 
The third part involved analyzing the channels and the total number of videos to identify the channel with the most videos.

Following that, I extracted details from a specific channel, including information about all the videos, such as Title, Published_date, Views, Likes, and Comments.

Subsequently, you can easily identify the videos with the highest views and their respective names.
